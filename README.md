# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
-The purpose of this project was to determine the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign as well as the most successful dollar amount to ask for. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-The main challenge I had was using =countifs, my excel version did not look like the canvas example or the excel example. I kept watching the hint videos and moving different parts of my formula around until the formula worked and my tests were accurate. Another challenge was that my final chart does not look like the example chart. I think that the data is somehow different or that I had filtered something incorrectly, but I was not able to figure out what the difference was. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	-The best time to launch a campaign is in May/June
-The worst time to launch a campaign is in December/January

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	-The best dollar amount to ask for is between 1k and 5k

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	-One limitation in the data is that successful doesn’t mean a successful Kickstarter campaign, there are several campaigns that failed but the project still got it’s complete funding as well as projects that exceeded their funding but were still canceled. 

	-Another limitation is that it’s unclear whether May/June are successful months or if there are just a lot of campaigns during those 
months since they contain the most successes and failures of the year.

-It’s also hard to say if these campaigns were successful because of the project or the location. If the campaign is taking place in a rural community, the campaign might fail at a higher rate, or ask for less money. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	-An additional table looking at the number of pledges or the amount of pledges vs success would be useful to better understand how many people need to donate in order to have a successful campaign.
